# CampusPulse | Modern College Event Management & Campus Activity Platform

A modern, responsive, full-stack **College Event Management System** designed for higher education institutions. CampusPulse bridges students, student club coordinators, faculty event organizers, and central college administrators into a unified, secure campus platform.

---

## Key Highlights & Standout Features

- **Dedicated Role Portals & Strict Access Control**:
  - **Student Portal** (`/student/login` & `/student/register`): Browse activities, one-click registration, interactive calendar, live digital QR entry passes, conflict alerts, and verifiable certificate downloads.
  - **Organizer Studio** (`/organizer/login` & `/organizer/register`): Submit event proposals, view live rosters, export CSV attendee records, broadcast announcements, scan QR entry passes, and issue verified certificates.
  - **Administrator Core** (`/admin/login`): High-security institutional portal strictly restricted to verified administrators. Rejects student and organizer logins, manages event approval workflows, oversees user privileges, analyzes participation analytics, and maintains immutable audit logs.
- **AI-Based Event Recommendations**: Rule-based algorithm matching student interest tags, degree majors, and engagement history against event categories and metadata to calculate personalized match scores.
- **Schedule Conflict Detector**: Automatically warns students when attempting to register for events overlapping in calendar day and session time.
- **QR-Code Digital Entry Passes**: Instant QR codes generated upon registration, compatible with smartphone screen scanning at venue check-in desks.
- **Attendance-Linked Verifiable Certificates**: Certificates of Participation issued to verified attendees with unique verification codes (`CERT-YYYY-XXXX-XXXX`) and public authentication at `/verify/:code`.
- **Zero-Config Resilient Database**: Connects to persistent MongoDB if configured via `MONGO_URI`. If no local MongoDB daemon is running, it automatically boots an embedded MongoDB memory server pre-loaded with realistic college events and accounts.

## Pre-Configured Demo Credentials

The platform is pre-seeded with realistic data across all three personas:

| Persona | Login Portal | Email | Password | Role Privileges |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Super Admin** | `/admin/login` | `admin@college.edu` | `Admin@12345` | Institutional governance, event moderation, user privileges, analytics, audit logs |
| **Faculty Organizer** | `/organizer/login` | `organizer@college.edu` | `Organizer@12345` | ACM Chapter advisor, creates events, manages rosters, scans QR passes, issues certificates |
| **Student** | `/student/login` | `student@college.edu` | `Student@12345` | Undergrad CS student, registers for events, views QR passes, earns certificates |

> [!NOTE]
> All login pages feature an **Auto Fill** button for instant one-click credential population during testing.

## Environment Configuration

A template `.env.example` is provided in the root directory.

```bash
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Database configuration: Leave blank or set custom URI.
# If MONGO_URI is omitted or unreachable, CampusPulse will automatically
# boot an in-memory database with pre-seeded college events.
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/college_events

# Security & Authentication
JWT_SECRET=super_secret_college_event_hub_jwt_key_2026_secured
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Initial Super Administrator

## Installation & Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **NPM**: v9.0.0 or higher
- Optional: MongoDB running locally on port 27017 (or use embedded memory fallback automatically)

### 1. Install Dependencies
In the root directory (or run separately in `client/` and `server/`):
```bash
# In server directory:
cd server
npm install

# In client directory:
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 2. Launch the Application
You can run both backend and frontend concurrently:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend API (Port 5000)
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend Client (Port 5173)
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open in Browser
- **Public Portal**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Student Sign In**: [http://localhost:5173/student/login](http://localhost:5173/student/login)
- **Organizer Studio**: [http://localhost:5173/organizer/login](http://localhost:5173/organizer/login)
- **Administration Portal**: [http://localhost:5173/admin/login](http://localhost:5173/admin/login)
- **API Health Check**: [http://localhost:5000/api/health](http://localhost:5000/api/health)

## Automated Verification Suite

Run the automated test suite to verify role protections, token handling, registration rules, and certificate validation:
```bash
cd server
node test-flows.js
```

## Deployment to Vercel

CampusPulse includes a production-ready `vercel.json` configuration at the repository root with Vite framework detection, automated client build commands, and single-page application (SPA) client-side routing rewrites.

### Option A: Connect via Vercel Web Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new).
2. Click **Add New Project** and select **Import Git Repository**.
3. Choose the repository: `yashhl16/EventManagementSystem`.
4. Configure Project Settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (default)
   - **Build Command**: `npm --prefix client run build` (auto-detected from `vercel.json`)
   - **Output Directory**: `client/dist` (auto-detected from `vercel.json`)
5. **Environment Variables**:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: URL of your deployed backend API (e.g., `https://your-backend-api.onrender.com/api` or `https://api.yourdomain.com/api`).
     *(If deploying full-stack or proxying, leave blank or point to your production API).*
6. Click **Deploy**. Vercel will build and serve your production application with automatic SSL and global CDN distribution.

### Option B: Deploy via Vercel CLI

In your terminal:
```bash
# 1. Log in to Vercel
npx vercel login

# 2. Deploy to Production
